intro_text,,"After climbing from an afterschool program participation rate of 10 percent in 2004 to 15 percent in 2009, Alabama lost ground in afterschool program participation in 2014, dropping back down to 13 percent.  However, parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs in the state are satisfied with their child’s program.  Ninety-four percent of Alabama parents surveyed are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program—5 percentage points higher than the national average.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs in Alabama continues to grow, increasing from 29 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009 to 41 percent in 2014. ","After losing ground in afterschool program participation from 2004 to 2009, the percentage of Alaska children taking part in an afterschool program crept up slightly, from 18 percent in 2009 to 19 percent in 2014.  The percentage of Alaska parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program remains above the national average–more than 9 in 10 parents.  Alaska also saw an increase in the percentage of parents extremely satisfied with their child’s afterschool program (74 percent), taking the number one spot in the nation.    ","The exceptionally high number of parents who report satisfaction with various aspects of their child’s afterschool program drives Arizona’s number six ranking in the top 10 states for afterschool.  Arizona parents who report they are extremely satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall almost doubled between 2009 and 2014.   However, while parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program has increased, the percentage of Arizona children in an afterschool program has stayed level from 2009 to 2014 and the average number of hours children spend in afterschool programs in Arizona dropped significantly, from more than 11 hours in 2009 to 6.79 hours in 2014.  ","Arkansas has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 8 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 13 percent in 2014.  However, Arkansas’ afterschool participation rate still falls well below the national average of 18 percent.  The average time Arkansas children spend in an afterschool program also falls below the national average in 2014, decreasing from approximately 7 hours per week to just more than 6 hours.  Additionally, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Arkansas continues to increase.  In 2004, 33 percent of children not enrolled in an afterschool program would participate if a program were available in their community.  In 2014, 45 percent of Arkansas children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available.  ","California has secured the number one spot in the top 10 states for afterschool, moving up from fourth in 2009.  The state’s afterschool program participation rate has surged over the past five years, increasing 6 percentage points from 2009 and serving more than 377,000 additional students across California.  Despite California’s high participation rates, high percentage of parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall, and strong support for public funding for afterschool programs, there is still significant unmet demand for afterschool programs in the state.  Half of children not enrolled in an afterschool program would be enrolled in one if a program were available to them.","Colorado has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 11 percent in 2004 to 13 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  However, Colorado’s afterschool participation rate still falls below the national average of 18 percent.  Colorado has also made progress with having fewer children alone and unsupervised after school.  Colorado’s percentage of unsupervised children dropped nearly 50 percent—from 31 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2014.  ","After an increase in afterschool program participation from 2004 to 2009, Connecticut saw a slight dip in the percentage of children taking part in an afterschool program—from 18 percent to 17 percent—bringing Connecticut below the national average.  Additionally, the average time children in Connecticut spend in an afterschool program decreased, from 8 hours in 2009 to 6.73 hours in 2014, also below the national average.  However, nearly all Connecticut parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program (96 percent).  ","After falling behind the national afterschool program participation average in 2009, Delaware has made up ground and caught up with the national average, with afterschool program participation rates increasing from 14 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2014.  The state also made significant progress decreasing the percentage of children in self-care from 31 percent in 2009 to 19 percent in 2014. However, there remain 40 percent of Delaware children not in an afterschool program who would be if one were available. ","The District of Columbia holds the number two spot in the top 10 states for afterschool in its first appearance in America After 3PM, driven primarily by the percentage of D.C.’s children who participate in afterschool programs and the amount of time that they spend in these programs.  However, there remain a significant number of children in the District of Columbia who are not able to take advantage of the opportunities afterschool programs have to offer, where 2 in 3 children (66 percent) in D.C. not enrolled in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them.","Florida jumped five spots in the top 10 states for afterschool from 2009, procuring the number three ranking in 2014.  Similar factors that drove Florida’s placement on the top 10 list in 2009 are responsible for its placement in 2014, primarily its strong afterschool participation numbers, above-average time children spend in afterschool programs, and a below average rate of children alone and unsupervised after school.  Afterschool programs in Florida serve a high-needs population; more than half of children (52 percent) who participate in an afterschool program qualify for the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program.  Satisfaction among Florida parents regarding their child’s afterschool program has also significantly improved from 2009.  Yet, there remain more than 1 million Florida children not currently in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if one were available to them.","For the first time, Georgia’s afterschool program participation rate falls below the national average, dropping back down to its 2004 level of 16 percent.  Additionally, despite strong parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program and parent support for public funding for afterschool programs, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Georgia continues to climb.  The percentage of children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available increased from 26 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2009 to 40 percent in 2014.   ","Hawaii rounds out the top 10 states for afterschool.  Similar to 2009, a strong afterschool participation rate—26 percent—is a primary contributing factor to its top 10 status.  While more than 9 in 10 parents support public funding for afterschool programs and Hawaii continues to be among the states with the highest afterschool participation rates, the percentage of children in an afterschool program has continued to decrease, dropping from 35 percent in 2004 to 28 percent in 2009 to 26 percent in 2014.  Similarly, the average amount of time Hawaii’s children spend per week in afterschool programs decreased in 2014 compared to 2004 and 2009, dropping from approximately 9 hours to 7.63 hours. ","The percentage of Idaho children participating in an afterschool program has hovered around 9 percent over the past decade, while the national average afterschool program participation rate has continued to climb.  While Idaho has slipped further behind other states in 2014, moving from 9 percent down to 8 percent program participation, the national average grew from 11 percent in 2004 to 18 percent in 2014. However, of Idaho parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs, an overwhelming majority—9 in 10—are satisfied with them overall. ","The percentage of Illinois children participating in an afterschool program has steadily increased over the past decade, climbing from 10 percent in 2004 to 16 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2014.  Illinois afterschool programs are also reaching more high-needs children, with the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program who qualify for the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program growing from 40 percent to 54 percent in 2014, nine percentage points above the national average.  Parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program also saw improvements from previous years.  In 2014, 8 in 10 Illinois parents surveyed said that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program, an increase from 74 percent of parents in 2009.","The percentage of Indiana children participating in an afterschool program has hovered around 10 percent over the past decade, while the national afterschool program participation rate has continued to climb.  Close to the national average in 2004, Indiana has slipped further behind other states in 2014, moving from 10 percent to 11 percent in 2014, whereas the national average grew from 11 percent in 2004 to 18 percent in 2014.  Although afterschool program participation remains stable, overall parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program has grown in Indiana.  In 2004, 80 percent of Indiana parents were satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall; in 2014, close to 9 in 10 parents are satisfied.  ","After holding steady at 11 percent in 2004 and 2009, Iowa saw a three percentage point increase in afterschool program participation in 2014, rising to 14 percent.   The average time Iowa children spend per week in afterschool programs also increased, from 6 hours in 2009 to more than 8 hours in 2014.  A greater number of Iowa parents were satisfied with their child’s afterschool program in 2014, with an increase in the percentage of parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program’s quality of care, variety of activities and cost when compared to 2009 responses.","Kansas has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 9 percent in 2004 to 13 percent in 2009 to 14 percent in 2014.  However, Kansas’ afterschool participation rate still falls considerably below the national average.  Parent satisfaction with various aspects of their child’s afterschool program saw some improvement from 2009 to 2014, for instance satisfaction with the program’s quality of care and variety of activities, yet parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall decreased 25 percentage points, falling below the national average.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs in Kansas holds steady from 2009 at 31 percent.  ","Kentucky continues to make progress regarding afterschool program participation, increasing from 7 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  Kentucky parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program’s quality of care, variety of activities and cost also saw improvements compared to 2009. ","Louisiana’s afterschool program participation rate and average amount of time children spend in an afterschool program both remain below the national average.  However, after a drop in afterschool program participation from 2004 to 2009, Louisiana saw an increase in 2014 back to their 2004 level of 15 percent.  The state did experience a substantial decrease in the time children spend in an afterschool program, dropping from 10 hours per week in 2009 to fewer than 7 hours in 2014.  Overall parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program remains steady and slightly above the national average at 91 percent.  ","After holding steady at 15 percent in 2004 and 2009, the percentage of Maine children participating in an afterschool program rose to 18 percent in 2014.  Additionally, while below the national average in overall parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program, Maine has made gains in this area, increasing from 84 percent of parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall in 2009 to 87 percent in 2014. ","While afterschool program participation increased from 10 percent in 2004 to 17 percent in 2009, Maryland experienced a slight drop in 2014 to 16 percent, bringing the state below the national average.   The amount of time children spend in an afterschool program also decreased, dropping from an average of 9 hours per week in 2009 to fewer than 7 hours per week in 2014.  Additionally, although 87 percent of Maryland parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall and 84 percent of parents support public funding for afterschool programs, there are more than 280,000 Maryland children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if a program were available to them. ","Two key drivers of Massachusetts’ fifth place rank in to top 10 states for afterschool are the high average amount of time per week  children spend in an afterschool program as well as an afterschool participation number above the national average, helping the state improve from a “state on the move” in 2009.  An overwhelming percentage of Massachusetts parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program (92 percent) and support public funding for afterschool programs (89 percent), yet there remain more than 350,000 Massachusetts children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if a program were available to them. ","Although Michigan’s afterschool program participation has increased over the past 10 years, the state continues to fall further behind the national average.  In 2004 and 2009, Michigan was three percentage points behind the national average; in 2014, with afterschool program participation at 13 percent, it falls 5 percentage points behind the national average.  Meanwhile, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Michigan continues to rise, increasing from 27 percent in 2004 to 35 percent in 2009 to 44 percent in 2014.","Minnesota’s afterschool program participation rate has continued to climb over the past decade, growing from 8 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  Additionally, the percentage of Minnesota children alone and unsupervised after school has decreased over the years, dropping from 35 percent in 2004 to 25 percent in 2014.  Although Minnesota’s afterschool program participation is below the national average, parents who are able to take advantage of the programs are satisfied.  Ninety-four percent of Minnesota parents report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program’s variety of activities and 92 percent report that they are satisfied with the quality of care—both above the national average.  ","After a decrease in afterschool program participation from 2004 to 2009, Mississippi made headway in 2014; afterschool program participation increased from 11 percent in 2009 to 16 percent in 2014.  However, Mississippi’s afterschool program participation still remains below the national average.  Mississippi parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program’s quality of care and cost also saw gains, from 80 percent to 93 percent and 73 percent to 91 percent, respectively.  ","After holding steady in 2004 and 2009, the percentage of Missouri children in an afterschool program increased from 12 percent to 14 percent in 2014. Additionally, parent satisfaction with the quality of care of their child’s afterschool program increased from 69 percent to 93 percent and satisfaction with the variety of activities increased from 65 percent to 85 percent.  ","The percentage of Montana children taking part in afterschool programs has changed very little over the past 10 years, hovering between 12 and 14 percent.  Currently at 13 percent, the participation rate in afterschool programs is well below the national average.  Although afterschool program participation has changed little, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Montana has grown from 26 percent in 2004 to 38 percent in 2014. ","Currently in its first year as one of the top 10 states for afterschool, Nebraska comes in at number eight.  Nebraska owes its place on the top 10 list primarily to the amount of time Nebraska children spend in afterschool programs—an average of nearly 10 hours per week.  The percentage of children in an afterschool program increased significantly, as did parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program’s cost and quality of care compared to 2009.  Additionally, an overwhelming percentage of Nebraska parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall (97 percent).","Nevada has seen significant progress through the years in the percentage of children participating in afterschool programs.  Nevada’s participation in afterschool programs has grown from 13 percent in 2004 to 16 percent in 2009 to 24 percent of children in 2014.  Additionally, Nevada parents’ satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall increased from 79 percent in 2009 to 92 percent in 2014.","New Hampshire saw an increase in afterschool program participation, from 16 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2014, as well as an increase in the time children spend in an afterschool program, from an average of 5 hours per week in 2009 to 7 hours per week in 2014.  The state also continues to make gains in parent satisfaction with afterschool programs, where an overwhelming majority of parents—96 percent—report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program, an increase from 77 percent in 2004 and 87 percent in 2009.    ","In 2009, the percentage of New Jersey children participating in an afterschool program increased to 14 percent from 12 percent in 2004, and the average time per week spent in an afterschool program reached 11 hours, among the highest in the nation that year.  In 2014, although New Jersey’s afterschool program participation moved up to 16 percent, it slipped further behind the national average, and the average time children spend in afterschool programs dipped to 6.58 hours per week, contributing to its fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to grow in New Jersey, increasing from 28 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2014. ","New Mexico’s afterschool program participation rate has fluctuated throughout the past 10 years, decreasing from 19 percent in 2004 to 17 percent in 2009 and back up to 21 percent in 2014.  While the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program has increased, the average amount of time spent in a program per week has decreased—dropping from 9 hours in 2009 to fewer than 7 in 2014—playing a role in New Mexico’s fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  Satisfaction with afterschool programs overall has remained high in New Mexico; currently 92 percent of parents report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program.","After a surge in afterschool program participation—from 15 percent in 2004 to 21 percent in 2009—afterschool program participation stayed level at 21 percent in 2014.  New York state’s decrease in the average time children spent per week in an afterschool program—dropping from 9 hours in 2009 to just more than 7 in 2014—in concert with a static afterschool program participation number, contributed to its fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  In addition, unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to climb.  In 2004, 36 percent of children not in an afterschool program would likely participate if a program were available.  In 2014, nearly half of children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them. ","Afterschool program participation in New York City remains strong, holding steady at 28 percent from 2009. More than 9 in 10 parents are satisfied with their child's afterschool program. However, despite strong afterschool program participation rates, unmet demand is high. Parents of more than 2 in 3 children not in an afterschool program say they would enroll their child if a program were available, higher than both New York state and the national average.","North Carolina has seen a steady increase in afterschool program participation during the past 10 years, growing from 10 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  However, the average time children spend in an afterschool program saw a drop in 2014, from 10 hours per week in 2009 to 6 hours in 2014, falling below the national average and contributing to North Carolina’s fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to grow; nearly 2 in 5 children—more than half a million children—not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them. ","After North Dakota’s afterschool program participation dropped from 14 percent in 2004 to 9 percent in 2009, it bounced back in 2014 to 20 percent, surpassing the national average.  The state also made gains when looking at parent satisfaction of their child’s afterschool programs overall as well as with the program’s quality of care, variety of activities and cost. ","Afterschool program participation in Ohio has risen from 7 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  Although parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program dropped slightly from 2009 to 2014, more than 9 in 10 Ohio parents still report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program.  While the state has seen an increase in afterschool program participation, unmet demand for afterschool programs also continues to grow—increasing from 30 percent in 2009 to more than half of children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them. ","Although Oklahoma’s afterschool program participation slipped slightly from 12 percent in 2009 to 11 percent in 2014, the state made gains in parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program.  In 2014, a higher percentage of Oklahoma parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall when compared to 2009 (94 percent vs. 81 percent), its quality of care (88 percent vs. 74 percent), the variety of activities (88 percent vs. 68 percent) and the program cost (81 percent vs. 69 percent).","Oregon is new to the list of top 10 states for afterschool, moving up from a “state on the move” in 2009.  Oregon’s seventh place rank is due to strong overall parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program, as well as with specific aspects of the program, including the program’s quality of care, variety of activities and cost.  However, the percentage of Oregon children who are alone and unsupervised after school is above the national average, and there remain more than 4 in 10 Oregon children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if a program were available to them. ","After holding steady at 9 percent in 2004 and 2009, the percentage of Pennsylvania children participating in afterschool programs increased to 17 percent in 2014, just below the national average.  Additionally, parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program increased from 84 percent in 2009 to 93 percent in 2014.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs also continues to climb, increasing from 26 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2009 to 50 percent in 2014.","Collecting data on Allegheny County for the first time, America After 3PM finds that afterschool program participation in Allegheny County is higher than both the national average and in Pennsylvania.  Nearly 3 in 10 Allegheny County children (28 percent) take part in an afterschool program, compared to 17 percent in Pennsylvania and 18 percent nationally.  An overwhelming majority of parents are also satisfied with their child’s afterschool program.  More than 9 in 10 Allegheny County parents surveyed with a child in an afterschool program report that they are satisfied with their child’s program overall.  However, unmet demand for afterschool programs is incredibly high in the area.  Seven in 10 Allegheny County children not enrolled in an afterschool program would if one were available to them.  ","Over the past decade, Rhode Island’s afterschool program participation rate has been above the national average, and 2014 is no exception.  The percentage of children participating in an afterschool program increased from 17 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in 2014.  In 2014, Rhode Island also made gains in parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program from 2009: a higher percentage of Rhode Island parents report satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall (90 percent vs. 77 percent), the quality of care (86 percent vs. 78 percent), the variety of activities (86 percent vs. 72 percent) and the program cost (90 percent vs. 51 percent).","After an increase in afterschool program participation from 13 percent in 2004 to 15 percent in 2009, the percentage of South Carolina children taking part in an afterschool program dropped back down to 13 percent in 2014, falling behind the national average.  The time children spend in an afterschool program also slightly decreased, from an average of 8 hours per week in 2009 to just more than 7 hours in 2014.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to rise in South Carolina, from 41 percent in 2004 to 46 percent in 2009 to 51 percent in 2014.","In 2009, South Dakota experienced a dip in afterschool program participation, from 16 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009.  This year, afterschool program participation grew slightly, to 14 percent, but remains well below the national average.  Similarly, although the percentage of children alone and unsupervised decreased in 2014—from 37 percent in 2009 to 27 percent in 2014—it is 7 percentage points above the national average.  Although below the national average, unmet demand for afterschool programs in South Dakota is high.  Nearly 1 in 3 children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them. ","This is Tennessee’s first year in the list of top 10 states for afterschool, with its entry driven by the high percentage of high-needs students served by afterschool programs.  More than half of Tennessee’s children in afterschool programs qualify for the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program.  The low percentage of children unsupervised after school as well as the high number of parents extremely satisfied with their afterschool program overall also contribute to Tennessee’s number nine spot.  Although the percentage of children participating in afterschool programs in Tennessee increased 5 percentage points from 2009 to 2014, the state remains in the middle of the pack regarding afterschool program participation and has more than a quarter of a million children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if one were available.","Over the past decade, the afterschool program participation rate has steadily increased, staying on par with the national average.  However, a decrease in the time children spend in an afterschool program–from an average of 9 hours per week in 2009 to fewer than 7 hours in 2014–as well as a decrease in parent satisfaction with some aspects of their child’s afterschool program, such as the variety of activities, has resulted in Texas falling out of the list of top 10 states for afterschool.  Despite dropping out of the top 10, 87 percent of Texas parents remain satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall and 4 in 5 parents support public funding for afterschool programs. ","The percentage of Utah children participating in an afterschool program has doubled over the past decade, growing from 5 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2014. However, the percentage of Utah children participating in an afterschool program as well as the amount of time per week Utah children spend in an afterschool program is markedly below the national average.  Ninety-two percent of Utah parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs are highly satisfied with their child’s afterschool program. ","Vermont is 1 of 6 states new to the top 10 list for afterschool in 2014.  A strong afterschool participation number and an increase in the average time children spend in afterschool programs are contributing factors to Vermont’s fourth-place ranking.  Strong parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall, the quality of care, and program cost are also drivers of Vermont’s entry into the top 10.  Despite the fact that 95 percent of Vermont parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program and 88 percent of parents support public funding for afterschool programs, unmet demand for afterschool programs in the state is high.  One in 3 children not enrolled in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them.  ","After jumping ahead of the national afterschool program participation rate in 2009, Virginia lost ground in 2014 as afterschool program participation decreased from 16 percent to 15 percent.  The average time Virginia children spend in an afterschool program also dropped slightly below the national average, from 8 hours per week in 2009 to 7.31 hours in 2014.  And, while Virginia’s parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program remains high at 87 percent, it dropped slightly from 92 percent in 2009.","Washington state has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 8 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2014.  However, Washington’s afterschool participation rate still falls just below the national average.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs in Washington has also seen an upward trend, increasing from 24 percent in 2004 to 27 percent in 2009 to 36 percent in 2014.  ","West Virginia continues to make gains in its afterschool program participation rate, from 6 percent in 2004 to 13 percent in 2009, and now above the national average to 19 percent in 2014.  West Virginia also saw an improvement in parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program from 2009 to 2014, from 81 percent to 88 percent.  However, unmet demand for afterschool programs in the state continues to grow, increasing from 30 percent in 2009 to 48 percent in 2014.   ","Although Wisconsin saw a slight increase in afterschool program participation and average time children spend per week in an afterschool program from 2009 to 2014, both remain below the national average.  And while approximately 8 in 10 Wisconsin parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall, this number decreased from 96 percent in 2009.  Support for public funding of afterschool programs is strong in the state, with more than 8 in 10 Wisconsin parents supporting public funding for afterschool programs. ","Wyoming’s afterschool participation rate decreased from 2009 to 2014, and at 15 percent, is currently below the national average.  And while approximately 2 in 3 Wyoming parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall, this number decreased from 77 percent in 2009.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs also increased, jumping from 28 percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2014, as did support for public funding of afterschool programs, from 74 percent in 2009 to 85 percent in 2014.

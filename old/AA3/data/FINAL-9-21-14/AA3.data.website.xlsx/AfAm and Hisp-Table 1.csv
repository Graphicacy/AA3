intro_text,"The need for afterschool programs is especially high in the African-American community. Although participation in an afterschool program is higher among African-American children than the national average, so too is the demand for programs.  Four in 5 African-American parents agree that afterschool programs help provide working parents peace of mind about their children while at work.  Agreement jumps even higher—to 88 percent—among African-American parents with a child in an afterschool program.  To help ensure that students in communities with few opportunities are able to access and afford afterschool programs, more than 9 in 10 African-American parents (91 percent) support public funding for afterschool programs. ","The need for and support of afterschool programs is especially high in the Hispanic community, where participation in afterschool programs, as well as demand for afterschool programs, has seen substantial growth.  More than 3 in 4 Hispanic parents agree that afterschool programs help provide working parents peace of mind about their children while at work and agreement jumps even higher—to 87 percent—among Hispanic parents with a child in an afterschool program.  To help ensure that students  in communities with few opportunities for children and youth are able to access and afford afterschool programs, close to 9 in 10 Hispanic parents (87 percent) support public funding for afterschool programs.

						<strong>Demand for afterschool programs</strong> continues to grow. Today, 10.2 million children participate in afterschool programs. Another 19.4 million children would participate if a program were available. A majority of school-age children either are, or want to be, in an afterschool program.

						<strong>Parents who have access</strong> to an afterschool program are highly satisfied with those programs. Parents agree that afterschool programs are providing a wide range of activities and enriching learning opportunities for their kids.

					<div class="showByCategory supportCategory">

						<strong>Afterschool programs play an important</strong>	 role in improving the health and wellness of our nation’s students.  Serving more than 10 million children and youth across America, with more than 19 million more who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them, afterschool programs have great potential to help prevent obesity and instill lifelong healthy habits that can help our nation’s students get healthy, stay healthy and lead healthier lives.

						<strong>Participation in summer learning programs is up,</strong> however, the demand for these programs is high. The most recent <em>America After 3PM</em> survey finds that 33 percent of families report that at least one child participated in a summer learning program in 2013, up from 25 percent of families in summer 2008. Still, more than half of families surveyed say that they want their children to participate in a summer learning program. With increased awareness of the problem of summer learning loss, parents recognize the value of summer learning programs to help their children succeed.

					<div class="showByCategory stemCategory">
						<strong>Afterschool programs have proven </strong> that they are vital partners in efforts to improve science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) interest and skills for young people in our nation. <em>America After 3PM</em> highlights how widespread STEM programming has become in afterschool and the positive view parents have of afterschool STEM programming.

"intro_text","AL","After climbing from an afterschool program participation rate of 10 percent in 2004 to 15 percent in 2009, Alabama lost ground in afterschool program participation in 2014, dropping back down to 13 percent.  However, parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs in the state are satisfied with their child’s program.  Ninety-four percent of Alabama parents surveyed are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program—5 percentage points higher than the national average.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs in Alabama continues to grow, increasing from 29 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009 to 41 percent in 2014. "

"intro_text","AZ","The exceptionally high number of parents who report satisfaction with various aspects of their child’s afterschool program drives Arizona’s number six ranking in the top 10 states for afterschool.  Arizona parents who report they are extremely satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall almost doubled between 2009 and 2014.   However, while parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program has increased, the percentage of Arizona children in an afterschool program has stayed level from 2009 to 2014 and the average number of hours children spend in afterschool programs in Arizona dropped significantly, from more than 11 hours in 2009 to 6.79 hours in 2014.

"intro_text","AR","Arkansas has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 8 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 13 percent in 2014.  However, Arkansas’ afterschool participation rate still falls well below the national average of 18 percent.  The average time Arkansas children spend in an afterschool program also falls below the national average in 2014, decreasing from approximately 7 hours per week to just more than 6 hours.  Additionally, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Arkansas continues to increase.  In 2004, 33 percent of children not enrolled in an afterschool program would participate if a program were available in their community.  In 2014, 45 percent of Arkansas children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available.  "

"intro_text","CA","California has secured the number one spot in the top 10 states for afterschool, moving up from fourth in 2009.  The state’s afterschool program participation rate has surged over the past five years, increasing 6 percentage points from 2009 and serving more than 377,000 additional students across California.  Despite California’s high participation rates, high percentage of parents satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall, and strong support for public funding for afterschool programs, there is still significant unmet demand for afterschool programs in the state.  Half of children not enrolled in an afterschool program would be enrolled in one if a program were available to them."

"intro_text","CT","After an increase in afterschool program participation from 2004 to 2009, Connecticut saw a slight dip in the percentage of children taking part in an afterschool program—from 18 percent to 17 percent—bringing Connecticut below the national average.  Additionally, the average time children in Connecticut spend in an afterschool program decreased, from 8 hours in 2009 to 6.73 hours in 2014, also below the national average.  However, nearly all Connecticut parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program (96 percent).  "

"intro_text","FL","Florida jumped five spots in the top 10 states for afterschool from 2009, procuring the number three ranking in 2014.  Similar factors that drove Florida’s placement on the top 10 list in 2009 are responsible for its placement in 2014, primarily its strong afterschool participation numbers, above-average time children spend in afterschool programs, and a below average rate of children alone and unsupervised after school.  Afterschool programs in Florida serve a high-needs population; more than half of children (52 percent) who participate in an afterschool program qualify for the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program.  Satisfaction among Florida parents regarding their child’s afterschool program has also significantly improved from 2009.  Yet, there remain more than 1 million Florida children not currently in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if one were available to them."

"intro_text","GA","For the first time, Georgia’s afterschool program participation rate falls below the national average, dropping back down to its 2004 level of 16 percent.  Additionally, despite strong parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program and parent support for public funding for afterschool programs, unmet demand for afterschool programs in Georgia continues to climb.  The percentage of children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available increased from 26 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2009 to 40 percent in 2014.   "

While more than 9 in 10 parents support public funding for afterschool programs and Hawaii continues to be among the states with the highest afterschool participation rates, the percentage of children in an afterschool program has continued to decrease, dropping from 35 percent in 2004 to 28 percent in 2009 to 26 percent in 2014.  Similarly, the average amount of time Hawaii’s children spend per week in afterschool programs decreased in 2014 compared to 2004 and 2009, dropping from approximately 9 hours to 7.63 hours. "

"intro_text","ID","The percentage of Idaho children participating in an afterschool program has hovered around 9 percent over the past decade, while the national average afterschool program participation rate has continued to climb.  While Idaho has slipped further behind other states in 2014, moving from 9 percent down to 8 percent program participation, the national average grew from 11 percent in 2004 to 18 percent in 2014. However, of Idaho parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs, an overwhelming majority—9 in 10—are satisfied with them overall. "

"intro_text","KS","Kansas has seen a steady increase in the percentage of children participating in an afterschool program—growing from 9 percent in 2004 to 13 percent in 2009 to 14 percent in 2014.  However, Kansas’ afterschool participation rate still falls considerably below the national average.  Parent satisfaction with various aspects of their child’s afterschool program saw some improvement from 2009 to 2014, for instance satisfaction with the program’s quality of care and variety of activities, yet parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall decreased 25 percentage points, falling below the national average.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs in Kansas holds steady from 2009 at 31 percent.  "

An overwhelming percentage of Massachusetts parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program (92 percent) and support public funding for afterschool programs (89 percent), yet there remain more than 350,000 Massachusetts children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if a program were available to them.

"intro_text","MN","Minnesota’s afterschool program participation rate has continued to climb over the past decade, growing from 8 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  Additionally, the percentage of Minnesota children alone and unsupervised after school has decreased over the years, dropping from 35 percent in 2004 to 25 percent in 2014.  Although Minnesota’s afterschool program participation is below the national average, parents who are able to take advantage of the programs are satisfied.  Ninety-four percent of Minnesota parents report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program’s variety of activities and 92 percent report that they are satisfied with the quality of care—both above the national average.

"intro_text","NE","Currently in its first year as one of the top 10 states for afterschool, Nebraska comes in at number eight.  Nebraska owes its place on the top 10 list primarily to the amount of time Nebraska children spend in afterschool programs—an average of nearly 10 hours per week.  The percentage of children in an afterschool program increased significantly, as did parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program’s cost and quality of care compared to 2009.  Additionally, an overwhelming percentage of Nebraska parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall (97 percent)."

The state also continues to make gains in parent satisfaction with afterschool programs, where an overwhelming majority of parents—96 percent—report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program, an increase from 77 percent in 2004 and 87 percent in 2009.

In 2014, although New Jersey’s afterschool program participation moved up to 16 percent, it slipped further behind the national average, and the average time children spend in afterschool programs dipped to 6.58 hours per week, contributing to its fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.

"intro_text","NY","After a surge in afterschool program participation—from 15 percent in 2004 to 21 percent in 2009—afterschool program participation stayed level at 21 percent in 2014.  New York state’s decrease in the average time children spent per week in an afterschool program—dropping from 9 hours in 2009 to just more than 7 in 2014—in concert with a static afterschool program participation number, contributed to its fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  In addition, unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to climb.  In 2004, 36 percent of children not in an afterschool program would likely participate if a program were available.  In 2014, nearly half of children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them. "

"intro_text","NC","North Carolina has seen a steady increase in afterschool program participation during the past 10 years, growing from 10 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  However, the average time children spend in an afterschool program saw a drop in 2014, from 10 hours per week in 2009 to 6 hours in 2014, falling below the national average and contributing to North Carolina’s fall out of the top 10 states for afterschool.  Unmet demand for afterschool programs continues to grow; nearly 2 in 5 children—more than half a million children—not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them.

"intro_text","OH","Afterschool program participation in Ohio has risen from 7 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2014.  Although parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program dropped slightly from 2009 to 2014, more than 9 in 10 Ohio parents still report that they are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program.  While the state has seen an increase in afterschool program participation, unmet demand for afterschool programs also continues to grow—increasing from 30 percent in 2009 to more than half of children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them.

Oregon’s seventh place rank is due to strong overall parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program, as well as with specific aspects of the program, including the program’s quality of care, variety of activities and cost.  However, the percentage of Oregon children who are alone and unsupervised after school is above the national average, and there remain more than 4 in 10 Oregon children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if a program were available to them.

"intro_text","Allegheny","Collecting data on Allegheny County for the first time, America After 3PM finds that afterschool program participation in Allegheny County is higher than both the national average and in Pennsylvania.  Nearly 3 in 10 Allegheny County children (28 percent) take part in an afterschool program, compared to 17 percent in Pennsylvania and 18 percent nationally.  An overwhelming majority of parents are also satisfied with their child’s afterschool program.  More than 9 in 10 Allegheny County parents surveyed with a child in an afterschool program report that they are satisfied with their child’s program overall.  However, unmet demand for afterschool programs is incredibly high in the area.  Seven in 10 Allegheny County children not enrolled in an afterschool program would if one were available to them.  "

"intro_text","SD","In 2009, South Dakota experienced a dip in afterschool program participation, from 16 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2009.  This year, afterschool program participation grew slightly, to 14 percent, but remains well below the national average.  Similarly, although the percentage of children alone and unsupervised decreased in 2014—from 37 percent in 2009 to 27 percent in 2014—it is 7 percentage points above the national average.  Although below the national average, unmet demand for afterschool programs in South Dakota is high.  Nearly 1 in 3 children not in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them. "

"intro_text","TN","This is Tennessee’s first year in the list of top 10 states for afterschool, with its entry driven by the high percentage of high-needs students served by afterschool programs.  More than half of Tennessee’s children in afterschool programs qualify for the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program.  The low percentage of children unsupervised after school as well as the high number of parents extremely satisfied with their afterschool program overall also contribute to Tennessee’s number nine spot.  Although the percentage of children participating in afterschool programs in Tennessee increased 5 percentage points from 2009 to 2014, the state remains in the middle of the pack regarding afterschool program participation and has more than a quarter of a million children not in an afterschool program who would be enrolled if one were available."

"intro_text","TX","Over the past decade, the afterschool program participation rate has steadily increased, staying on par with the national average.  However, a decrease in the time children spend in an afterschool program–from an average of 9 hours per week in 2009 to fewer than 7 hours in 2014–as well as a decrease in parent satisfaction with some aspects of their child’s afterschool program, such as the variety of activities, has resulted in Texas falling out of the list of top 10 states for afterschool.  Despite dropping out of the top 10, 87 percent of Texas parents remain satisfied with their child’s afterschool program overall and 4 in 5 parents support public funding for afterschool programs. "

"intro_text","UT","The percentage of Utah children participating in an afterschool program has doubled over the past decade, growing from 5 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2014. However, the percentage of Utah children participating in an afterschool program as well as the amount of time per week Utah children spend in an afterschool program is markedly below the national average.  Ninety-two percent of Utah parents who are able to take advantage of afterschool programs are highly satisfied with their child’s afterschool program. "

"intro_text","VT","Vermont is 1 of 6 states new to the top 10 list for afterschool in 2014.  A strong afterschool participation number and an increase in the average time children spend in afterschool programs are contributing factors to Vermont’s fourth-place ranking.  Strong parent satisfaction with their child’s afterschool program overall, the quality of care, and program cost are also drivers of Vermont’s entry into the top 10.  Despite the fact that 95 percent of Vermont parents are satisfied with their child’s afterschool program and 88 percent of parents support public funding for afterschool programs, unmet demand for afterschool programs in the state is high.  One in 3 children not enrolled in an afterschool program would be enrolled if one were available to them.  "

"intro_text","African.American","The need for afterschool programs is especially high in the African-American community. Although participation in an afterschool program is higher among African-American children than the national average, so too is the demand for programs.  Four in 5 African-American parents agree that afterschool programs help provide working parents peace of mind about their children while at work.  Agreement jumps even higher—to 88 percent—among African-American parents with a child in an afterschool program.  To help ensure that students in communities with few opportunities are able to access and afford afterschool programs, more than 9 in 10 African-American parents (91 percent) support public funding for afterschool programs.

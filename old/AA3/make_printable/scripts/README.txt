Downloaded and installed wkhtmltopdf form this link: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

Tested it out w `wkhtmltopdf /detail.html#s/WI/demand/p_of_children_in_programs_2014 wkhtmltopdf_detail_test.pdf` Success! Looks just as good as the online tools (tho def not perfect)

Now trying a ruby script to automate it further

Success!

FOOTNOTE,Poverty,text,"The percentages and projected numbers of children and families in <i>America After 3PM</i> are based on survey responses from parents. Nationally, 30,720 households were screened, and 13,709 households completed in-depth interviews.  Communities of concentrated poverty are neighborhoods, or groupings of neighborhoods, in a community where there is a high concentration of families that live below the federal poverty line.  In 2016, the federal poverty guideline for a family of four was $24,300.  Scholars have included areas with at least 20 percent of families living below the poverty line up to at least 40 percent of families living below the poverty line as a community of concentrated poverty.  For the purposes of <i>America After 3PM</i>, survey respondents designated as those living in communities of concentrated poverty are those that meet the two following criteria: 
1) Live in a zip code that falls within a census tract that the Census Bureau has designated as a community of concentrated poverty, and 
2) Live in a zip code that has a poverty rate of 30 percent or above. 
Based on the above criteria, 622 households living in communities of concentrated poverty were screened for this study."
